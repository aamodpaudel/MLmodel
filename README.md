# learningmodel
It contains pre-hybrid version of the model initially based on CNN only just to test out the images. We can tweak it to make it a hybrid CNN-ViT model. 

The code directory contains the three python files: one for setting up the dataset, another for training the model & the third one for predicting the results using the trained model.

The dataset directory contains the pre-trained four image directory files: angry, sad, relaxed, happy.

The datasets are splitted on 80:20 ratio on /train & /val directories respectively. 

The predictions directory lists the images that we want to test.

The trained model directory lists the pytorch extension file for the output.
